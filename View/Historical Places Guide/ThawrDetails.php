            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Jabal-E-Thawr, or the Mountain of Thawr, holds a special place in Islamic history as the site where Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and his companion Abu Bakr (RA) took refuge during their migration (Hijrah) from Makkah to Madinah. They spent three days in a cave on the mountain, hiding from the Quraysh who were pursuing them. During this time, Allah sent a miracle: a spider spun a web and a bird laid eggs at the entrance of the cave, making it appear undisturbed. This event is a testament to Allah's protection and the unwavering faith of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and Abu Bakr (RA). Visiting Jabal-E-Thawr is a deeply spiritual experience, allowing one to reflect on the trials and triumphs of the early Muslim community.</p>
