            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Masjid Al-Taneem, also known as Masjid Aisha, is a significant miqat (entry point) for pilgrims and visitors entering the state of Ihram for Umrah. Located about 7 kilometers from Masjid Al-Haram in Makkah, it is a convenient and spiritually uplifting location for those preparing to perform Umrah. The mosque is named after Aisha (RA), the beloved wife of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), who entered Ihram from this site. Masjid Al-Taneem is well-equipped with facilities for changing into Ihram clothing and offers a peaceful environment for worship and reflection. A visit to this mosque is a meaningful step in the journey of Umrah.</p>
