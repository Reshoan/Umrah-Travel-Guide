            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Jannatul Mualla, located in Makkah, is one of the oldest and most revered cemeteries in Islamic history. It is the final resting place of many of the Prophet Muhammad's (peace be upon him) family members and companions, including his beloved first wife, Khadijah (RA). The cemetery holds immense spiritual significance and is a place of deep reflection and reverence for visitors. Walking through Jannatul Mualla, one is reminded of the transient nature of life and the eternal legacy of faith. The serene atmosphere and historical importance make it a must-visit site for pilgrims seeking to connect with the early days of Islam.</p>
