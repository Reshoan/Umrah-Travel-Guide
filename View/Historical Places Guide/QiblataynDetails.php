            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Masjid Al-Qiblatayn, located in Madinah, is one of the most historically significant mosques in Islam. It is renowned as the place where the direction of the qibla was changed from Jerusalem to the Kaaba in Makkah during the Prophet Muhammad's (peace be upon him) time. This event, mentioned in the Quran, marks a pivotal moment in Islamic history. The mosque features two mihrabs, one facing the old qibla and the other facing the Kaaba, symbolizing this profound change. Visitors are often struck by the mosque's serene atmosphere and its deep connection to the early days of Islam. A visit to Masjid Al-Qiblatayn is a journey through time, offering a glimpse into the rich heritage of the Muslim Ummah.</p>
