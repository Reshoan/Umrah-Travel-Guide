            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Cave Hira, located on Jabal Al-Noor (Mountain of Light) in Makkah, is one of the most sacred sites in Islamic history. It was here that Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) received the first revelation of the Quran from Angel Jibreel (AS). This momentous event marked the beginning of Islam and the prophethood of Muhammad (peace be upon him). The cave is a small, serene space that offers breathtaking views of the surrounding mountains. Pilgrims and visitors often climb the mountain to experience the tranquility and reflect on the profound spiritual significance of this site. A visit to Cave Hira is a deeply moving experience, connecting one to the very origins of Islam.</p>
